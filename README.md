# LainGame

### General Description

LainGame is an inspired by all things Lain, and is meant to be it's own story and world.
Gameplay will feature a daily cycle where you go from a day at work, to a night of relentlessly searching for answers.

### Story

Try to unravel the secrets of it all by exploring the Wired...
Tome, a silent observer in the Wired, comes back home from work to get back to his hobby.
The hobby being investigating the people who live in the Wired.
Their thoughts -- binary, and their domain -- the storage servers, the wires, and the datacenters that prop up society.
Over the course of days, chipping away at the obfuscation...
Visit all the places in the Wired, and try to find out what's happening, which way the wind's blowing.
Figure out what you must do about it, why it pulls you so tightly in.
Explore the Wired, a place that connects us all... Each server a place of it's own.
